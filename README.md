Solar System 3D Visualization

This project is a 3D simulation of the solar system, built using React Three Fiber (a React wrapper for Three.js). It features interactive controls that allow users to zoom, pan, and rotate around the planets. Each planet orbits around the Sun with realistic motion and textures.

Technologies Used

React for building the user interface.

React Three Fiber for handling 3D rendering.

Three.js for creating and animating 3D objects.

@react-three/drei for additional utilities and enhancements.
