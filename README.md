# 🌌 Solar System 3D Visualization

Explore the wonders of our solar system with this immersive **3D simulation**, built using **React Three Fiber**, a powerful React wrapper for Three.js. This project offers an interactive experience where you can **zoom, pan, and rotate** around the planets, observing their realistic orbits and detailed textures.
